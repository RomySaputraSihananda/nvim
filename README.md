# my neovim configuration

This config is based on [Kickstart.nvim](https://github.com/nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim). You can use it for pretty much anything, but I've tuned it for React development.

It's lightweight and works fine on my machine. Here's the profile:

```
LazyStart 14.14ms
LazyDone  52.77ms (+38.63ms)
UIEnter   81.83ms (+29.06ms)
```
